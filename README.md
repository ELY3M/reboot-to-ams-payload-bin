Are you tired of have to update the fusee.bin in the /bootloader/payloads or somewhere?     

this payload bin make it easy to load atmosphere.     
this payload only link to the reboot_payload in folder atmosphere on your sd card.  

this payload bin will just boot atmosphere.   

Just drop this bin in /bootloader/payloads or rename it to payload.bin and put it on the root of sd card for mod chip users.  

Thank you very much to CTCaer!
